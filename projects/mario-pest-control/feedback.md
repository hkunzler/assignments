Good styling and excellent use of responsive design.

Nice work learning about using alt tags for images and importing custom fonts.

Great indentations and spacing.  It is clear and very easy to read.

Validating user input data is good practice and we will learn more about this when we get into unit testing. Avoiding problems before they come up is great. I havent seen that yet on this project.  Nicely done.  
If you want to continue doing that consider other use cases you could check.  For example you could block negative numbers, etc.

Good work.  You are doing great.
